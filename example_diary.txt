It was the first time. The first time I saw death as a comfort. I saw my life ending as a comforting experience. I wasn't afraid of death one bit. If I was hit crossing this street, I wouldn't mind one bit. I walked to the pharmacy, and bought as much as I could, or what I thought would be enough. I walked back to campus. I proceeded to buy more pills from the campus center. I went to the bathroom to swallow everything. I realized this might not be enough. I kept thinking it might not be enough. But, I just gave up. I thought " I'll just take my chances." I continued my day after swallowing all these pills. I saw a blood donor truck. I was hoping they woukd take out my blood, so it would give me more of a chance at death. The problem was.. my pulse was too high (150), she said she couldn't take my blood because of that reason.

I went to my morning class. We had a guest speaker. I couldn't walk straight. I tried to use tables and slowly walk down to my seat. That was a task of its own. I found myself dosing in and out while sitting in my seat. Everyone's words felt like background noise. There was a calmness I had. I felt so calm and ready. I felt like words wouldn't come out of my mouth.

I couldn't understand anyone. I couldn't complete any thoughts. Nor I hear the questions being answered. This didn't feel like a mistake. Not one bit. It felt right to me.

The whole experience feels like a distant dream, that I can't confirm whether it happened or not
